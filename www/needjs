<h1>JavaScript Required</h1>

<p>The function you're attempting to use requires JavaScript.  If your
browser is JavaScript-capable but you've disabled scripting in your
preference settings, you'll have to re-enable it to access this
feature.

<h2>If JavaScript is enabled...</h2>

<p>If you have a JavaScript-capable browser, and scripting is already
enabled, here are a couple of possibilities for what went wrong...

<p><b>Did you open a link in a new tab or window?</b> If you reached
this page by trying to open a hyperlink in a new tab or a new window
(by Shift-Clicking or Ctrl-Clicking on the link, for example), try
going back and clicking on the link normally.  <b>Tip:</b> many of our
"Help" links automatically open a pop-up window, to avoid interrupting
what you were doing, so there's no need to explicitly open a new
tab/window for these.

<p><b>There might be an error in one of our scripts.</b> If a
JavaScript error occurs in a script link, the browser will sometimes
act as though there's no script at all, which has the effect of taking
you to this page as though JavaScript weren't enabled.  This might
indicate a bug in the page.  You might try going back and reloading
the page, in case it didn't load properly; if the problem persists,
you can <a href="contact">contact us</a> to let us know about it.
