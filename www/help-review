<h1>Review Guidelines</h1>

<p>A good review is more than just a one-liner saying how much you
liked (or didn't like) the game.  Think about it from the perspective
of someone <i>reading</i> the review - they want to know <i>why</i>
you feel the way you do about the game.

<p><b>Describe your own tastes.</b> A reader who hasn't played the
game yet would like to know if it's the sort of thing they'd enjoy.
It helps to know if a reviewer has similar taste, so
describe how the game measures up to your specific likes and dislikes.

<p><b>Be specific.</b> Readers like concrete details: things like the
the difficulty level, playing time, writing style and quality, tone,
how much the focus is on puzzles vs. story, and so on.

<p><a name="spoilers"></a><b>Avoid spoilers.</b> A spoiler is
information that gives away one of the game's secrets - the solution
to a puzzle, a plot twist, etc.  Many people who read your review
won't have played the game yet - don't take away their chance to
discover the game's secrets on their own.

<b>If you can't avoid spoilers, mark them.</b> Sometimes it's
difficult to entirely avoid spoilers.  If you really feel it's
important to include something spoilery in your review, mark it
like so:
<p><pre>
  &lt;spoiler&gt;This is a spoiler!&lt;/spoiler&gt;
</pre>
<p>IFDB will hide the text within the &lt;spoiler&gt;...&lt;/spoiler&gt;
section until the reader clicks a button to explicitly reveal it.

<p><b>Avoid referring to other member reviews on the page.</b> The
order and placement of reviews can change, and people can edit their
reviews, so any references you make could lose their context and
become confusing as the game's page evolves.

<p><b>Be courteous.</b> Please don't use profanity, attack other users, or
stray off the topic - try to keep the focus on the game. See our
<a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> for more details.

<p><b>Keep the length reasonable.</b>  We recommend in the neighborhood
of two or three paragraphs: long enough to give a detailed review, but
respectful of the reader's time.  That said, it's fine to go longer,
even much longer, if you have a lot to say about a game.  We just
don't want you to feel like you have to fill up pages for a homework
assignment.
