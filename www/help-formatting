<h1>Formatting Hints</h1>

<p>You can use some limited HTML-style formatting code <?php if ($review) { ?>as well as Markdown<?php } ?> in this field.

<?php if ($review || $comment) { ?>

<p><a name="spoilertags"></a><b>&lt;SPOILER&gt; ...
&lt;/SPOILER&gt;</b> - marks everything between the tags as "spoilers"
- information that reveals the game's secrets.  A reader who hasn't
played the game might not want to see this, since it would spoil the
fun of discovery when they play.  IFDB will hide this text until the
reader clicks a button saying they want to see it.

<?php } ?>

<p><b>&lt;B&gt; ... &lt;/B&gt;</b> - the text between the &lt;B&gt; and
   &lt;/B&gt; is shown in <b>boldface</b>.
    <?php if ($review) { ?>Alternatively, wrap text in two asterisks <b>**...**</b>.<?php } ?>

<p><b>&lt;I&gt; ... &lt;/I&gt;</b> - the text between the &lt;I&gt; and
   &lt;/I&gt; is shown in <i>italics</i>.
    <?php if ($review) { ?>Alternatively, wrap text in one asterisk <b>*...*</b> or one underscore <b>_..._</b><?php } ?>

<p><b>&lt;BR&gt;</b> - line break: ends the current line and starts a new
   one, with no extra space between the lines.
    <?php if ($review) { ?>Alternatively, just enter a line break with your keyboard.<?php } ?>

<p><b>&lt;P&gt;</b> - paragraph break: shows a blank line between the paragraphs.
    <?php if ($review) { ?>Alternatively, enter two line breaks with your keyboard.<?php } ?>

<p><b>&lt;BR/&gt;</b> - paragraph break (this is provided so that you can
   copy text from an <a href="https://babel.ifarchive.org">iFiction</a>
   XML file - the iFiction format uses &lt;BR/&gt; for paragraph breaks)

<p><b>&lt;CODE&gt;</b> - monospace text, representing programming code
    <?php if ($review) { ?>Alternatively, wrap text in backticks <b>`...`</b>.<?php } ?>

<p><b>&lt;A GAME="<i>tuid</i>"&gt; ... &lt;/A&gt;</b> - hyperlink the text
between the &lt;A&gt; and &lt;/A&gt; to a game.  <i>tuid</i> is the
<a href="help-tuid">TUID</a> identifying the game.  Rather than writing
this out by hand, you can use our
<a href="gamelink">game hyperlink generator</a>.

<p><b>&lt;A HREF="<i>url</i>"&gt; ... &lt;/A&gt;</b> - hyperlink the
text between the &lt;A&gt; and &lt;/A&gt; to any Web site.  (For
safety reasons, Javascript isn't allowed.  The URL must start with
<tt>http://</tt>, <tt>ftp://</tt>, or <tt>news:</tt>.)
    <?php if ($review) { ?>Alternatively, write a URL by itself (starting with <samp>http://</samp> or <samp>https://</samp>)  <b>**...**</b>
        to link the raw URL. Or, <b>[your-text](your-URL)</b> to display text within brackets which links to a URL within parentheses.<?php } ?>

<p><b>&amp;lt;</b> - a less-than sign (&lt;)

<p><b>&amp;gt;</b> - a greater-than sign (&gt;)

<p><b>&amp;amp;</b> - an ampersand (&amp;)

<?php if (!$review) { ?><p>If you use any of the line or paragraph break codes, then any
newlines in your text will be ignored - we'll assume that you wanted
to control the line formatting entirely with the HTML-style codes.
On the other hand, if you <b>don't</b> use any break codes at all,
we'll assume that you wanted any newlines in the text to show up
literally as line breaks in the displayed version.<?php } ?>

<?php if ($review) { ?>

    <p><b>>...</b> (at the beginning of a line) - blockquotes: indents the line following the greater-than sign,
        and any subsequent lines which are separated by only one line break.
        Adding two line breaks will return the text to its normal non-indented display.
    </p>

    <p><b>*...</b> (at the beginning of a line) - bullet point/unordered list: indents the line and adds a bullet point before it.
        Any subsequent lines separated by only one line break will be indented as well.
        Adding two line breaks will return the text to its normal non-indented display.
    </p>

    <p><b>1. ...</b> or any other number (at the beginning of a line) - numbered list/ordered list: indents the line and includes the number before it.
        Any subsequent lines separated by only one line break will be indented as well.
        Adding two line breaks will return the text to its normal non-indented display.
    </p>

    <p>If you would like to use symbols such as asterisks, underscores, backticks, greater-than signs, etc.
        <i>without</i> IFDB treating them as markdown and converting them to HTML tags like italics, blockquotes, and bullet points,
        add a backslash before the symbols: \*heavy sigh\*; \*\*\*YOU HAVE DIED\*\*\*; \> GET LAMP, and so on.</p><?php } ?>
