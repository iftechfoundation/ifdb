<h1>Formatting Hints</h1>

<p>You can use some limited HTML-style formatting code in this field:

<?php if ($review || $comment) { ?>

<p><a name="spoilertags"></a><b>&lt;SPOILER&gt; ...
&lt;/SPOILER&gt;</b> - marks everything between the tags as "spoilers"
- information that reveals the game's secrets.  A reader who hasn't
played the game might not want to see this, since it would spoil the
fun of discovery when they play.  IFDB will hide this text until the
reader clicks a button saying they want to see it.

<?php } ?>

<p><b>&lt;B&gt; ... &lt;/B&gt;</b> - the text between the &lt;B&gt; and
   &lt;/B&gt; is shown in <b>boldface</b>.

<p><b>&lt;I&gt; ... &lt;/I&gt;</b> - the text between the &lt;I&gt; and
   &lt;/I&gt; is shown in <i>italics</i>.

<p><b>&lt;BR&gt;</b> - line break: ends the current line and starts a new
   one, with no extra space between the lines.

<p><b>&lt;P&gt;</b> - paragraph break: shows a blank line between the paragraphs.

<p><b>&lt;BR/&gt;</b> - paragraph break (this is provided so that you can
   copy text from an <a href="http://babel.ifarchive.org">iFiction</a>
   XML file - the iFiction format uses &lt;BR/&gt; for paragraph breaks)

<p><b>&lt;A GAME="<i>tuid</i>"&gt; ... &lt;/A&gt;</b> - hyperlink the text
between the &lt;A&gt; and &lt;/A&gt; to a game.  <i>tuid</i> is the
<a href="help-tuid">TUID</a> identifying the game.  Rather than writing
this out by hand, you can use our
<a href="gamelink">game hyperlink generator</a>.

<p><b>&lt;A HREF="<i>url</i>"&gt; ... &lt;/A&gt;</b> - hyperlink the
text between the &lt;A&gt; and &lt;/A&gt; to any Web site.  (For
safety reasons, Javascript isn't allowed.  The URL must start with
<tt>http://</tt>, <tt>ftp://</tt>, or <tt>news:</tt>.)

<p><b>&amp;lt;</b> - a less-than sign (&lt;)

<p><b>&amp;gt;</b> - a greater-than sign (&gt;)

<p><b>&amp;amp;</b> - an ampersand (&amp;)

<p>If you use any of the line or paragraph break codes, then any
newlines in your text will be ignored - we'll assume that you wanted
to control the line formatting entirely with the HTML-style codes.
On the other hand, if you <b>don't</b> use any break codes at all,
we'll assume that you wanted any newlines in the text to show up
literally as line breaks in the displayed version.
