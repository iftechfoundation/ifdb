<h1>Formatting Hints</h1>

<p>You can use some limited HTML-style formatting code in this field.
   If you check the "Convert Markdown formatting to HTML" checkbox,
   then Markdown syntax will also be parsed where noted.

<?php if ($review || $comment) { ?>

<p><a name="spoilertags"></a><b>&lt;SPOILER&gt; ...
&lt;/SPOILER&gt;</b> - marks everything between the tags as "spoilers"
- information that reveals the game's secrets.  A reader who hasn't
played the game might not want to see this, since it would spoil the
fun of discovery when they play.  IFDB will hide this text until the
reader clicks a button saying they want to see it.

<?php } ?>

<p><b>&lt;B&gt; ... &lt;/B&gt;</b> - the text between the &lt;B&gt; and
   &lt;/B&gt; is shown in <b>boldface</b>. <i>Markdown</i>: you can use two ** on either side of the text like **this**.

<p><b>&lt;I&gt; ... &lt;/I&gt;</b> - the text between the &lt;I&gt; and
   &lt;/I&gt; is shown in <i>italics</i>.
   <i>Markdown</i>: you can use a single * or _ on either side of the text like *this* or _this_.

<p><b>&lt;BR&gt;</b> - line break: ends the current line and starts a new
   one, with no extra space between the lines.
   <i>Markdown</i>: Entering a line break via the Enter or Return key creates a paragraph break no matter what.

<p><b>&lt;P&gt;</b> - paragraph break: shows a blank line between the paragraphs.
<i>Markdown</i>: you can just enter a line break by pressing the Enter or Return key on your keyboard.

<p><b>&lt;BR/&gt;</b> - paragraph break (this is provided so that you can
   copy text from an <a href="https://babel.ifarchive.org">iFiction</a>
   XML file - the iFiction format uses &lt;BR/&gt; for paragraph breaks)

<p><b>&lt;A GAME="<i>tuid</i>"&gt; ... &lt;/A&gt;</b> - hyperlink the text
between the &lt;A&gt; and &lt;/A&gt; to a game.  <i>tuid</i> is the
<a href="help-tuid">TUID</a> identifying the game.  Rather than writing
this out by hand, you can use our
<a href="gamelink">game hyperlink generator</a>.

<p><b>&lt;A HREF="<i>url</i>"&gt; ... &lt;/A&gt;</b> - hyperlink the
text between the &lt;A&gt; and &lt;/A&gt; to any Web site.  (For
safety reasons, Javascript isn't allowed.  The URL must start with
<tt>http://</tt>, <tt>ftp://</tt>, or <tt>news:</tt>.) <i>Markdown</i>: you can enter a bare link
   like <i>https://google.com</i> and it will automatically link,
or add description text like this: [link description](https://google.com)

<p><b>&amp;lt;</b> - a less-than sign (&lt;)

<p><b>&amp;gt;</b> - a greater-than sign (&gt;)

<p><b>&amp;amp;</b> - an ampersand (&amp;)

<p>If you use any of the line or paragraph break codes <i>without markdown</i>, then any
newlines in your text will be ignored - we'll assume that you wanted
to control the line formatting entirely with the HTML-style codes.
On the other hand, if you <b>don't</b> use any break codes at all,
we'll assume that you wanted any newlines in the text to show up
literally as line breaks in the displayed version.
