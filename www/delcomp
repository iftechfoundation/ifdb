    <b>Are you sure you want to delete this competition's listing?</b> 

    <p>If you click "Yes" below, the listing will be permanently
    deleted.  This action is irrevocable - it can't be undone. If you 
    change your mind later, you'll have to re-enter the competition
    information from scratch.

    <p>The main valid reason to delete a competition listing is that
    you've discovered that it's a duplicate - that is, that there
    was already a listing for the same competition before you created
    this one.

    <p>Keep in mind that if you delete a listing, any links from
    other web sites to the listing will be broken.  It's safest
    to delete a listing that you created very recently, because
    it's less likely that anyone will have found it and linked
    to it.

    <p>Do you still want to delete this listing?
