<h1>Linking a game to your profile</h1>

<p>If you're the author of a game listed in IFDB, you can link it to your
profile.  This will automatically include the game in a list of
authorship credits on your public profile page, and it will include a
link to your profile next to your name as it appears in the byline on
the game's overview page.

<p>To link a game to your profile, follow these steps:

<ul class=doublespace>

   <li>Go to the game's main page

   <li>Click "Edit this page" at the bottom of the game page

   <li>In the Author field, insert your profile ID (the
   <a href="help-tuid">TUID</a>) in {curly braces} after
   your name. For example, <b>Arthur Dent {0x098109klasd09313k}</b>.
   You can find the TUID on your main profile page.

   <li>Save your changes.  A link to your profile will now appear
   on the game's page after your name in the byline, and the game
   will be listed in your profile's authorship section.

</ul>

<h2>Unlinking a game</h2>

<p>To remove a profile link from a game, just edit the game's listing
and remove your profile ID (the <b>{xxxxxxx}</b> code) from the Author
field.
