<h1>How does IFDB pick games to recommend?</h1>

<p>The recommendations on the IFDB home page are "algorithmic" -
they're picked by the computer based on statistics in the database.
They're <i>not</i> paid ads - they're based purely on ratings from our
members and review sites like
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110109233058/http://www.wurb.com/if"
target="_blank">Baf's Guide</a>.  We're not being paid to promote one
game over another.

<p>The system picks front-page recommendations by looking for other
members with similar patterns of likes and dislikes to your own, as
expressed in the ratings they gave to the games they reviewed.  IFDB
tries to match you up with a few other members, then recommends games
that those other members rated highly.

<p>In principle, the more ratings you and other members provide,
the more accurate the matching will become.  So the recommendations
should get better and better as you rate more games.

<p>This approach is sometimes called "collaborative filtering."  Some
people think it's great, others are skeptical.  The obvious objection
is that it doesn't capture the <i>reasons</i> that you like the games
you like, so it might match you up with someone who happens to like
some of the same games, but for completely different reasons.  There's
obviously no guarantee that the approach will actually produce good
advice, but we hope that it gives you at least a few leads on games
that you might otherwise have overlooked.

<p>If the algorithmic recommendations on the home page don't work for
you, remember that IFDB still offers several ways to get
<i>personal</i> recommendations from other users, such as member
reviews and Recommended lists.
