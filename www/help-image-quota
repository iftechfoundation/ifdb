<h1>Why is there an image limit?</h1>

<p>The limit on image uploads for style sheets is to ensure there's
enough space on our server for everyone who wants to use this
feature.

<p>Our server resources are limited, so we unfortunately can't offer
an infinite, general-purpose image hosting service for your vacation
photos, eBay listings, etc.  We created the Style Sheet Image Manager
specifically to give you more control when customizing IFDB, by making
it easier to add your own images to your custom style sheets.  The
limits should be more than adequate for this purpose, but if you do
find yourself running out of space, <a href="contact">contact us</a>.
