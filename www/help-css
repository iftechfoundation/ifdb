<h1>CSS Help</h1>

<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a Web standard, like HTML, so it's
easy to find documentation about it on the Internet.  Here are a
couple of pointers to get you started:

<ul>
   <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">
      Wikipedia: Cascading Style Sheets</a>
   <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1" target="_blank">
      Cascading Style Sheets, Level 1</a>
      (the official specification from W3C)</a>
</ul>

<h2>Import the Default Style Sheet</h2>

<p>Here's an important tip: you should always start your custom style sheets
with this line:
<p><pre>
   @import url("/ifdb.css");
</pre>
<p>This includes all of the styles from the default IFDB style sheet,
so that you only have to define <i>exceptions</i> to the standard
formatting.  Everything you add to your style sheet will override the
imported defaults, but anything you <i>don't</i> override will fall back
on the defaults.  This ensures that if any new styles are added in the
future, they'll be supported automatically in your style sheet by
virtue of being included from the standard definitions.

<h2>Custom Graphics</h2>

<p>A style sheet can override most of the graphics on IFDB.  To use
your own custom graphics, you first need to upload your images to IFDB
using the <a href="/stylepics" target="_blank">Style Sheet Image
Manager</a>.  Once you've uploaded your images, you can use them in a
style sheet - look at the standard style sheet (<a href="/ifdb.css"
target="_blank">ifdb.css</a>) and search for "background:" styles to
see how it's done.
