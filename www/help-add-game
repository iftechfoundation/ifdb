<h1>Guidelines for New Game Listings</h1>

<p>
<li>IFDB is for <b>interactive fiction</b>, which is roughly
defined as "adventure" type games that are mostly or entirely text-based.
Games with graphical content are allowed as long as they have a
significant text component.

<p>
<li><b>Don't</b> list non-IF games, such as entirely graphical
adventures, RPGs, shooters, etc.

<p>
<li><b>Commercial IF</b> is acceptable, whether classic or new.
You can add a commercial game of your own, but please read
our <a href="help-edit-game">guidelines</a> about what goes
in your listing.

<p>
<li><b>Don't</b> add separate listings for different versions of
a game.  Any given game should have only <b>one</b> listing that covers
<b>all</b> of its release versions.
