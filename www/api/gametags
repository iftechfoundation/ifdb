<p>The gametags API lets applications read tags on IFDB games.</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>

<p>The gametags API is implemented as an http JSON web service at
<tt>https://ifdb.org/gametags?json</tt>. All parameters are passed as
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> POST data with the HTTP request.
As typical for HTTP, there's no
session state or context; the entire transaction is carried out as
the single request.

<h2>Parameter names and values</h2>

<p><b>id</b>: the <a href="https://ifdb.org/help-tuid">TUID</a> for
the game you want to update. Ordinary text parameter; required.

<p><b>mine_only</b>: if this parameter is set, then we'll only return
the tags that your username has set on the current game. Boolean
parameter; optional.

<p><b>username</b>: the IFDB username for the account under which the
listing will be created.  Ordinary text parameter; required if
<tt>mine_only</tt> is true.

<p><b>password</b>: the user's IFDB password. Ordinary text parameter;
required if <tt>mine_only</tt> is true.

<h2>Reply format</h2>

<p>The server replies to the request with an XML object describing the
result.  The response has this tag structure for a successful
transaction:

<p><pre>
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "example",
      "tagcnt": 1,
      "gamecnt": 58
    },
  ]
}
</pre>

<p><tt>tagcnt</tt> shows how many users have used that tag on the
currently selected game. (Normally, <tt>tagcnt</tt> will be 1, because
it's unusual for a player to add a tag when the game already has that
tag.)

<p><tt>gamecnt</tt> tag shows how many games have used that tag.
