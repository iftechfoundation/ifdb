<p>The putific API provides a way for application programs to add new
game listings to IFDB, or update existing listings.

<p>The usual way to create or edit an IFDB listing is through the IFDB
Web form interface.  The Web form is, of course, designed for direct
interaction with a human user.  The API provides a programmatic
alternative, for situations where an application program has access to
its own representation of a game's structured metadata, and wishes to
send the data to IFDB without forcing the user to re-type the same data
into a Web form.

<p>This API was designed primarily for IF IDE-type tools, such as TADS
Workbench or the Inform 7 IDE.  These tools create and edit IF game
projects, so by their nature they keep track of project metadata.  The
particular use case we envision for an IDE is a menu command (or
something similar) to "Publish to IFDB".  This would cause the IDE to
send the project metadata to IFDB via this API, in order to create or
update the IFDB listing for the game.  This would save the user the
trouble of re-entering the project metadata via the IFDB web form.

<p>The metadata format used in the putific API is iFiction, the XML
format defined by the <a href="http://babel.ifarchive.org/">Treaty of
Babel</a> specification.  iFiction is the obvious format for our
purposes here, since it was was specifically designed for metadata
interchange among sites like IFDB and the IF Archive, tools such as an
Inform or TADS IDE, client programs that act as IF browsers or
jukeboxes, etc.  IFDB's own game listing format was designed with the
iFiction spec in mind, so an iFiction input file maps to an IFDB
listing with excellent fidelity.


<h2>Basic protocol</h2>

<p>The putific API is exposed as an HTTP POST request to a particular
URL on the IFDB Web site.  The URL is <tt>http://ifdb.tads.org/putific</tt>.

<p>All parameters are passed as POST data with the HTTP request.  As
typical for HTTP, there's no session state or context; the entire
transaction is carried out as the single POST request.

<p>The parameters to the API are provided in the usual HTTP POST
fashion, by encoding them into the content body of the POST as though
they were HTML form input field values being sent with a form
submission.  HTTP defines a number of Content-Type encodings that work
with the POST verb, but this API requires a particular format.
Specifically, the parameters <b>must</b> be provided as a content body
with MIME type "multipart/form-data".  This is required because of the
need to attach one or more files to the request (the iFiction file,
and optionally the Cover Art image file), and this is the standard
HTTP way of handling file uploads using HTML forms.  This format also
handles ordinary scalar data parameters, and can freely mix scalar
data values with file uploads.

<p>The server replies to the POST with an XML object describing the
result of the request.  The contents are described below.

<h2>Constructing multipart/form-data requests</h2>

<p>The easiest way to construct a POST request meeting the API's
requirements is to use a Web client library with support for POST
requests with multipart/form-data payloads.  If that's not available,
constructing the payload manually is fairly straightforward.  For the
benefit of hand-coders, this section outlines how to construct the
payload.  For full details, see the formal multipart/form-data
specification in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388">RFC 2388</a>.

<p>The overall form of the request body is a series of sections
separated by "boundary" lines.  A boundary line is just some fairly
arbitrary text that's chosen so that it can't be confused with
anything in any of the actual content being sent.  Specifically, it's
a string of characters that doesn't appear as a leading substring of
any line of characters occurring in any of the content sections.  The
usual algorithm for constructing a boundary line is to pick a fairly
long sequence of random letters and numbers (10-20 characters, say),
then scan the content to verify that the sequence isn't a leading
substring of any line of the content items.  If the sequence does
happen to appear, simply pick another sequence and scan again.  Long
random sequences are statistically unlikely to occur in the data, so
this process should find a suitable boundary string quickly.

<p>To construct a boundary line in the payload, start a line with two
hyphens (ASCII 45), followed by the boundary string, followed by a
CR-LF (ASCII 10-13) sequence.

<p>The payload begins with a boundary line.

<p>The end of the payload is indicated by a special boundary line that
adds two hyphens (ASCII 45) at the end of the boundary string (just
before the CR-LF).

<p>Immediately after each boundary line is a Content-Disposition line.
There are two forms for this line: one for ordinary data parameters,
and one for file attachments.

<p>An ordinary data parameter is identified with a content-disposition
line like this:

<p><pre>
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="foo"
</pre>

<p>A file attachment has a similar content-disposition line, but adds
a "filename=" parameter.  It also must be followed by two additional
header lines giving the MIME type of the file attachment and the
transfer encoding:

<p><pre>
   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="coverart"; filename="mypic.jpg"
   Content-type: image/jpeg
   Content-transfer-encoding: binary
</pre>

<p>The content-type should be text/xml for the iFiction attachment,
and image/jpeg, image/png, or image/gif for the cover art image.

<p>For this API, always use the <b>8bit</b> encoding for text files
(including UTF-8), and the <b>binary</b> encoding for image files.
Don't use base64 or other text-encapsulated formats for image files,
as the Apache/php combination we're using doesn't seem to decode these
properly.

<p>Following the content-disposition line (and the additional content
headers for file attachments), add a blank line (i.e., another CR-LF
pair), followed immediately by the content data for the section.  For
an ordinary parameter item, this is simply the plain text of the
parameter value.  For a file, this is the contents of the file.  Since
we transfer binary files with the "binary" transfer encoding, you
should simply copy a binary file into the payload byte for byte.

<p>The end of the section's content is indicated by a CR-LF pair
followed immediately by a boundary line.  The CR-LF just before the
boundary is considered to be part of the boundary, so it must be
present in all cases, including binary files.

<p>Once the payload is constructed, it's simply sent to the server
with an HTTP POST verb and a Content-Type header like so:

<p><pre>
   Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary="asdfjkl"
</pre>

<p>Note that the boundary value specified in the POST content-type
header does not include the "--" prefix that appears with each
boundary line within the content body.


<h2>Parameter names and values</h2>

<p><b>username</b>: the IFDB username for the account under which the
listing will be created.  Ordinary text parameter; required.

<p><b>password</b>: the user's IFDB password. Ordinary text parameter;
required.

<p><b>ifiction</b>: the iFiction XML file upload.  Use content-type
text/xml.  The file name and suffix aren't important; the server
ignores these and always tries to parse this file as XML regardless of
the filename.  See the <a href="#links">download links</a> section
for details on the XML format.  File upload parameter; required.

<p><b>links</b>: the downloadable file link list.  This is an XML
attachment, like the iFiction file.  Use content-type text/xml.  The
file name and suffix are ignored; this is always treated as an
XML file.  File upload parameter; optional.

<p><b>coverart</b>: the Cover Art image for the game listing.  If
present, this must be a valid JPEG, PNG, or GIF file.  There's an
upper limit on the file size, which is currently 256K bytes; uploading
an image over the limit will cause an error reply.  It's not necessary
for the client detect which image format is being submitted or to
validate the image, since the server does this itself, and ignores the
filename, extension, and content-type.  So, for example, if you submit
a JPEG image as a file named FOO.GIF with an image/png content type,
the server will still know it's a JPEG.  If you try submit a Word
document with the same name and type, the server will reject it as an
invalid image.  If you happen to know the image type, you should
specify correct content-type (image/jpeg, image/png, or image/gif),
since it's conceivable that the API could become stricter in the
future about the content-type header matching the actual submitted
data.  If you don't know the image type, use image/x-unknown; again,
in the event the server needs to become stricter about matching types,
this will tell the server that the client isn't claiming to know the
type.  File upload parameter; optional.

<p><b>imageCopyrightStatus</b>: the copyright status of the image;
IFDB records this in the database with the image.  The parameter value
must match one of the following strings:

<ul>
   
   <li><b>by permission</b>, meaning that the copyright owner has
   explicitly granted permission to IFDB to use the image

   <li><b>creative commons</b>, meaning that the copyright owner has
   released the image under the Creative Commons license described
   in the IFDB Terms of Service

   <li><b>free software</b>, meaning that the copyright owner has
   released the image under some type of free software license
   that allows its use on IFDB

   <li><b>fair use</b>, meaning that the uploader believes that using
   the image on IFDB falls under "fair use" provisions of U.S. copyright
   law

   <li><b>public domain</b>, meaning that the image is in the public domain

   <li><b>unspecified</b>, meaning that no status is specified.  (We
   discourage using this status.  The most likely time that a user
   is going to think about this at all is when performing the upload,
   so if they don't specify a status with this request, they probably
   won't go back add the information later.)

</ul>

<p>The default is "unspecified".  Ordinary text parameter;
optional.

<p><b>imageCopyright</b>: the copyright message for the image, as a
text string (e.g., "Copyright 2009 Bob Smith").  The value can be any
text.  If this omitted or empty, and the copyright status is not
"public domain" or "unspecified", a default copyright message will be
generated of the form "Copyright (year) by (author)", where "year" is
the current year and "author" is the author name from the iFiction
record.  Ordinary text parameter; optional.

<p><b>requireIFID</b>: This parameter can be supplied with the value
"no" to override the usual rule that an IFID must be provided in the
iFiction record.  This should <b>never</b> be used by an IF IDE that's
submitting an author's own game project for publication.  Any IF IDE
that's using this API should conform to the Babel specification at
least as far as generating a proper IFID for each game project, so
there should never be a need for an IDE to submit a game without an
IFID.  Instead, this parameter is specifically intended for clients
importing information on old commercial games for which no copy of the
executable is available: without an executable, it's not even possible
to construct the MD5-based IFID that Babel specifies for legacy games.

<p>When this parameter is included with the value "no", the API is
<b>only</b> capable of creating a new game record, and requires the
title of the game to be unique (that is, if there's an existing game
with the same title, ignoring upper/lower case differences, the new
listing will be rejected).  We discourage using this parameter except
as a last resort; in particular, if you <i>could</i> compute the MD5
IFID for the game (because you have a copy of the executable, or could
legally get one), but you just haven't done so, the inconvenience of
computing the MD5 IFID is a poor excuse for using this override.
Providing an IFID (even if it's just an MD5 hash) is highly desirable
because it helps reduce the chances that someone else will create a
redundant listing for the same game.

<p>Ordinary text parameter; optional.

<h2>iFiction records</h2>

<p>The iFiction file included in the request must be syntactically
valid XML.  The API does not validate against any XML schema, so you
can use custom tags beyond what's in the Babel spec (to store
development system-specific extensions to the basic Babel metadata,
for example).  The file must be encoded in the UTF-8 character set,
although be aware that IFDB will convert content data to ISO-8859-1
(Latin-1), so there could be loss of fidelity for characters outside
of the 8859-1 subset of Unicode.

<p>As in the Babel spec, the file must not contain any entity markups
beyond the primitive XML set, namely &amp;lt; for &lt;, &amp;gt; for
&gt;, and &amp;amp; for &amp;.  HTML markups are not allowed within
field values, except for the markup &lt;br/&gt; to represent a
paragraph break in the &lt;description&gt; item.

<p>The following Babel fields are used for the corresponding IFDB
   fields:

<ul>
   <li>title
   <li>author
   <li>firstpublished
   <li>format (the Babel names are mapped to equivalent "friendly" names
   that are conventionally used on IFDB for the various systems)
   <li>language
   <li>description
   <li>series
   <li>seriesnumber
   <li>genre
   <li>forgiveness
   <li>bafn
   <li>contacts/url
</ul>

<p>In addition to the fields listed above, the game's current version
number is inferred from the releases/attached/release/version item, if
present, otherwise from the first releases/history/release/version
item in order of appearance in the file.  If none of those items are
present, the API uses the TADS-specific item tads2/version, if
present.

<p><b>Required fields:</b> The iFiction file must minimally include
the game's IFID(s), title, and author.  (The IFID requirement can be
overridden with the <b>requireIFID</b> parameter, though, as described
above.)  All other items are optional.


<h2><a name="links">Download links</h2>

<p>The request can optionally provide a list of downloadable files to
add to the game listing.  You will usually want to include at least a
link to the downloadable story file, but you can also include any
desired supplemental files (such as hints, maps, instructions,
walk-throughs, or "feelies").  These are listed on the game's IFDB
page in the "Downloads" section.

<p>Note that IFDB doesn't host game downloads.  It only links to them.
The download section is simply a list of URLs to files on other
servers; you don't attach any of the actual game files to the request,
just pointers to them.

<p>The download list is specified via an XML file, attached to the
request via the <b>links</b> parameter.  The XML content is formatted
as follows:

<p><pre>
   &lt;downloads xmlns="http://ifdb.tads.org/api/xmlns"&gt;
      &lt;links&gt;
        link 1
        link 2
        ...
      &lt;/links&gt;
   &lt;/downloads&gt;
</pre>

<p>Each link item has this format:

<p><pre>
   &lt;link&gt;
      &lt;url&gt;URL to the file&lt;/url&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Title of the file&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;desc&gt;Description of the file&lt;/desc&gt;
      &lt;isGame/&gt;
      &lt;pending/&gt;
      &lt;format&gt;File format ID&lt;/format&gt;
      &lt;os&gt;Operating system ID and version&lt;/os&gt;
      &lt;compression&gt;File format ID for compression type&lt;/compression&gt;
      &lt;compressedPrimary&gt; &lt;/compressedPrimary&gt;
   &lt;/link&gt;
<p>

</pre>

<p>You should always include a URL, title, and format.  The OS and OS
version are required for application program files, and shouldn't be
included for file types.  The other fields are optional.

<p>The URL is the full, absolute URL for the file, starting with
"http://".  For files hosted on the IF Archive, <b>always</b> provide
the URL of the <b>main IF Archive</b> server, <b>not</b> a mirror.
IFDB has special recognition of IF Archive URLs.  In particular, each
user can set a preferred Archive mirror, and IFDB will automatically
rewrite IF Archive URLs to point instead to the selected mirror when
that user is viewing a game's page.  If you specify a URL that points
to a mirror site, IFDB won't be able to make this preference
adjustment.

<p>The title is the displayed title of the file, which serves as the
hyperlinked text.  It's friendliest to users to use a descriptive
name, such as "Story File" or "Installer", but many IFDB links just
use the root filename (i.e., the last part of the URL, stripped of any
path prefix).

<p>The description is additional descriptive text to be displayed with
the link.  This is plain text (no HTML markup).

<p><b>isGame</b> should be included if this link points to a playable
version of the game, such as a story file or an executable
application, <i>or</i> it's a compressed file that <i>contains</i> a
playable version of the game.  For example, &lt;isGame/&gt; should be
included for a ZIP file containing a Z-Machine story file for the
game.  Omit this for supplemental files (documentation, walk-throughs,
etc).

<p><b>pending</b> should be included if the provided URL isn't a
working link yet, but is expected to be working soon.  This is
designed especially for use with IF Archive uploads.  When you upload
a file to the Archive, you can generally predict the final URL for the
file based on the Archive's directory layout conventions.  However,
the file won't actually appear at this URL immediately after uploading
it, since the Archive administrators review uploads before moving them
to their final directory location.  This process usually takes a few
days.  This is inconvenient for the IDE "publish" command that the
putific API is designed for: the publisher will want to perform the IF
Archive upload and IFDB page creation in a single process, but
creating the IFDB page right after the IF Archive upload means that
either you have to put up with a broken link for a few days, or make
the user come back and fill in the link manually when it's actually
working.  Neither option is very good.  This is where the "pending"
flag comes in.  The flag tells IFDB that the link isn't good yet, so
IFDB will hide the link from the game's home page.  It also tells IFDB
that the link will be good soon, though.  IFDB acts on this by
periodically testing the link to see if it works.  As soon as the link
starts working, IFDB will remove the "pending" flag and show the
download link with the listing.

<p><b>format</b> gives the file's format.  This is specified as
an "External ID" code for the file type, which you can find
on the <a href="/fileformat">File Formats</a> page.

<p><b>os</b> gives the file's operating system and version.  This
should be specified <b>only</b> for binary machine-code executable
application files, such as Windows .EXE files or Unix binaries.  Don't
include this for Virtual Machine "story file" types such as z-code or
TADS, since these files are portable to multiple machines.  Don't
include it for document types (PDF, Word, ASCII text, GUE maps, etc),
since these files are also not inherently tied to a single type of
machine.

<p>The operating system is specified as a <b>two part</b> External ID
for the OS.  The first part is the external ID for the OS itself, and
the second is the OS version.  The two parts are separated by a period
'.'.  You can find the list of versions for each OS by going to the <a
href="/opsys">Operating Systems</a> page, then clicking on the OS you
want to look up.  The OS page has a list of "Version &amp; Download
Adviser entries".  Each version shows the External ID string for the
OS/version combination.  For example, Windows 95's External ID is
"Windows.95".

<p>IFDB's basic assumption for OS versioning is that applications for
version N of a given OS will also run on version N+1.  You should
therefore always specify the <b>earliest</b> OS version that the
executable will run on; IFDB will automatically offer it to people who
are using later versions of the same OS.  (When our backward
compatibility assumption fails to hold, we simply treat the newer,
incompatible OS version as a whole new operating system.  That's why
Mac OS is in the list twice: once as Mac OS 7-9, and separately as Mac
OS X.)

<p><b>Important:</b> for a compressed file, such as a ZIP file,
specify the format and OS for the <b>contents</b> of the compressed
file, rather than the compression format itself.  IFDB considers the
compression to be just a wrapper; what's important is what's inside.
For an archive format like ZIP or Tar that can group multiple files
together, specify the format of the "primary" file - see
<b>compressedPrimary</b> below for details.

<p><b>compression</b> gives the file format for a compressed file,
such as a ZIP or .tar.gz file.  Specify this only when there is indeed
some kind of compression or wrapper format.  For our purposes, we call
any sort of archive wrapper format a "compression" format, even if
there's no actual data compression.  For example, you'd specify "tar"
here for a .tar file, even though Tar doesn't involve any data
compression.

<p>As we just mentioned, the <b>format</b> entry for a
compressed file gives the format of the contents rather than of the
compression wrapper; so the <b>compression</b> element is where the
compression wrapper format is specified.  The value here is an
External ID taken from the <a href="/fileformat">File Formats</a>
list.

<p><b>compressedPrimary</b> gives the filename of the "primary" file
within a compressed or archive file.  This is the name of the primary
file after extraction.  If there's a directory path, use the path
relative to the container, since you obviously can't guess at the
absolute directory structure where a user will eventually extract the
file.  Use URL/Unix-style "/" paths if there's a path prefix.  For
formats like Tar or ZIP that actually store filenames within the
wrapper, use the stored filename.  For formats like GZIP where the
extracted filename is derived from the compressed file's name, specify
the name that the extraction tool conventionally derives, assuming
that the user will use the filename from the URL for the local copy.

<p>Which file is "primary"?  For a format like GZIP that only wraps a
single file, the primary file is obviously just the wrapped file.  For
multi-file wrappers like ZIP or Tar, it's up to you to pick the
primary file, but there's one special consideration: if there's a
playable version of the game within the archive, such as a story file
or executable, you should always designate that as the primary file.
This allows the Download Adviser to generate instructions for playing
the game given the compressed file.  If there's no playable game file,
pick whichever file is the most important, or whichever one the user
would most directly want to open or view.  For example, for a ZIP
containing an HTML page and a bunch of GIFs and JPEGs displayed on the
page, the HTML page would presumably be the primary.

<p>If there's no good basis for designating a particular file as
primary, you can omit simply omit this element.  Note that you should
still set a valid file type for the &lt;format&gt; element.  Use the
file type of the majority of the contents if possible, otherwise you
can just use the generic "document" type as a last resort.  For a
collection of source files, for example, you'd specify the format as
"text".


<h2>Restrictions</h2>

<p>If the submitted IFID refers to an existing IFDB listing, the
effect is to update the existing listing, as though using the standard
IFDB listing editor Web interface.  Updating a listing is allowed
<b>only</b> if the submitting user is the same as the last user who
edited the page.  If another user last edited the page, an edit
request is rejected.  This is because we have to assume that we have a
three-way merge conflict: some other user has edited the on-line
listing, and meanwhile the current user has edited her private,
off-line copy of the iFiction data.  The current user now intends to
update the on-line listing with her updated iFiction data, but we
can't assume that she knows about the other user's edits to the
on-line copy.  We thus reject the POST update request, and instead
require the current user to go to the IFDB Web-based listing editor
and edit the live on-line data manually.  The current user can still
decide to go ahead with the updates, but by requiring her to manually
edit the live on-line data, we ensure that she at least sees the other
user's changes before overwriting them.

<p>If the submitted iFiction record contains multiple IFIDs, and any
of the IFIDs are already present on IFDB in existing listings, the
IFIDs in the iFiction record must <b>all</b> refer to the same game.
It's fairly obvious why this must be the case: a given IFID refers to
exactly one game; so a group of IFIDs purporting to refer to the same
game (by being grouped together in a single iFiction record) can't
also refer to any other games.  Therefore, if the IFIDs in the
iFiction record refer to two or more existing IFDB listings, the
request is rejected with an error.  Note, however, that it's fine for
there to be a mix of IFIDs that exist on IFDB and IFIDs that don't:
this would be the case if the updated listing is adding IFIDs to an
existing listing.  The restriction is simply that all IFIDs in the
iFiction record that already exist on IFDB must all point to the same
listing.

<p>The download links specified through the API are purely additive.
When the API is used to update an existing listing, the download links
in the request are merged with the download links from the existing
record.  The merging is by URL:

<p>
<ul>

   <li>For an existing download link with a URL matching a
   download link in the API request, the data from the request (title,
   description, etc) replaces the existing data.

   <li>For an existing link with a URL that <i>doesn't</i> match any
   link in the API request, the existing link is kept with no changes.

   <li>For a link in the API request that doesn't match any URL in
   the existing download links, the API request link is added to the
   list, after all of the existing links.

</ul>

<p>There's one exception to the replacement rule for a matching URL.
If the link in the API request is marked as "pending", and the old
link with the same URL is <b>not</b> marked pending, the pending flag
in the request is ignored.  The rationale is that the non-pending
status in the existing record presumably means that the link already
works for an older version of the same game, and that what's really
"pending" in the new request is the replacement of that file with the
new version.  So even though the request client thinks of the link as
pending, it's not actually a broken link; it's only pending in that
the version update isn't complete yet.  It seems better to keep the
existing link to the old game in the interim, so that users viewing
the page will find something to download, even if it's not necessarily
fully up to date yet.

<p>The reason that the download links are additive is that the links
presented through the request API are presumably the files published
directly by the author of the game, but existing links might refer to
other "unofficial" files created by third parties, such as hints or
walk-throughs.  We don't want to delete those third-party files just
because the author is updating her published files.  So, we simply
retain any existing links without changes when they're not mentioned
in the request.  In the simplest case, when the request doesn't
include any download links, this means that we make no changes
at all to the existing links.


<h2>Reply format</h2>

<p>The server replies to the request with an XML object describing the
result.  The response has this tag structure for a successful
transaction:

<p><pre>
   &lt;putific xmlns="http://ifdb.tads.org/api/xmlns"&gt;
      &lt;ok/&gt;
      &lt;ACTION-NAME/&gt;
      &lt;tuid&gt;TUID (IFDB's internal ID) of the listing&lt;/tuid&gt;
      &lt;viewUrl&gt;URL of page for viewing the listing&lt;/viewUrl&gt;
      &lt;editUrl&gt;URL of page for editing the listing&lt;/editUrl&gt;
   &lt;/putific&gt;
</pre>

<p>ACTION-NAME is one of the following:

<ul>
   <li><b>created</b> means that a new listing was created
   <li><b>edited</b> means that an existing listing was updated
   <li><b>unchanged</b> means that the listing already existed and
       was identical to the iFiction data, so the server left the
       existing record as it was
</ul>

<p>The TUID is the internal IFDB identifier for the game listing that
was created or updated by the request.

<p>The viewUrl is an http URL to the main IFDB page for the listing.
The editUrl is a URL to reach a user interface for editing the listing
manually.

<p>If an error occurs, the reply has this structure:

<p><pre>
   &lt;putific&gt;
      &lt;error&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;error code&lt;/code&gt;

<p>The error code is a computer-friendly identifier for the error,
from the following list:

<ul>
   <li>BadAtt: a file attachment to the HTTP POST is invalid.
   <li>MissingParam: a required parameter to the HTTP POST is missing.
   <li>Login: IFDB login failed, usually due to an invalid username or
       password.
   <li>XmlSyntax: an XML file attachment to the POST is not syntactically
       valid XML.
   <li>MissingTitle: the title is missing from the iFiction record.
   <li>IfidsNotUnique: the IFIDs in the record match more than one game.
       (This is only possible when multiple IFIDs are specified.  It means
       that the different IFIDs match different games, which is not
       allowed since all IFIDs in the iFiction record must be for the
       same game.)
   <li>IfidMissing: the IFID is missing from the iFiction record.
   <li>TitleNotUnique: the title is not unique.  This error can only occur
       when no IFID is specified, and the IFID override option is selected.
       If an IFID is specified, the title doesn't have to be unique since
       the IFID definitively identifies the game.
   <li>LoadRecord: the game has an existing page, but an error occurred
       loading its database record.
   <li>CannotMerge: the game has an existing page, and the last version of
       the page was edited by a different user.  The iFiction record can't
       be used to update the page because it might inadvertently overwrite
       the other user's changes.  The user must manually update the page
       via the IFDB Web interface.
   <li>ImageCprInvalid: the imageCopyrightStatus parameter value
       is invalid.
   <li>ImageFormatError: the image contents are invalid.  The image either
       isn't in of the supported formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF), or the contents
       aren't well-formed for the format.  The server ignores the
       submitted Content-type and filename, and instead infers the format
       by inspecting the actual submitted image data, looking for an image
       header that matches one of the supported types.
   <li>ImageTooBig: the image exceeds the size limit (currently 256K).
   <li>DataValidation: one or more of the iFiction fields contains
       invalid data.  This could be due to a missing required value,
       a formatting problem (such as for a
       date value), an enumerated value that doesn't match any of the
       allowed values, a number out of range, etc.  One or more field
       detail items will be included for this error indicating the
       specific problem.
   <li>DbError: a database error occurred.  This type of error should
       only occur due to either a bug in the API or a (presumably
       temporary) service outage on the server side, so there's generally
       nothing the client can do to fix this, although you could advise
       the user to retry later in case it is indeed a service outage
       that's eventually resolved.
</ul>

<p>The error message text is human-readable text describing the error
condition.  The "detail" items are included when the error is due to
an invalid value for one of the submitted iFiction fields.  The field
ID is the XPath description of the iFiction element containing the
error, without the top-level "story" tag; for example, the "author"
field is identified as "bibliographic/author".  The field description
is a human-readable description of the field, for display to users.
The field-specific error message is a human-readable message
describing the value error.  The server validates all of the fields
before returning an error and adds a "detail" item for each error, so
there could be multiple "detail" items in the reply.

<p>When an error is returned, the server will not have saved any
portion of the updates; the whole create/update operation fails
atomically.  This means that no further client action is required to
clean up after the failed request, and also that it's safe to simply
try again by posting a new request (which the user will probably want
to do if the error involved a data validation problem that can be
corrected by editing the source data).
