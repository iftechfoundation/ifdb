The IFDB search API provides programmatic access to IFDB's full-text
and structured-data search capabilities.  The API replicates the
functionality of IFDB's main Search Web interface.

<h2>Protocol</h2>

<p>The search API is implemented as a simple http XML service.
Parameters are encoded into a URL query string, and the URL is sent to
IFDB as an http GET request.  The server replies with an JSON content
body that contains the search results.

<p>Optionally, you can also sign in with your IFDB email address
and password using HTTP Basic Authentication, using the
<code>Authorization: Basic ...</code> header. This will allow you
to perform searches "as yourself", e.g. searching for games you've
played with <code>played:yes</code>.

<p>The root of the URL is <tt>https://ifdb.org/search?json</tt>.

<p>The search term and object type are added to the root URL as query
parameters, using standard URL encoding.  That is, each parameter is
appended as <tt>&amp;<i>paramName</i>=<i>paramValue</i></tt>.  Each
parameter value is encoded with spaces converted to "+" signs, and
"unsafe" characters converted to the "%xx" notation (where xx is the
hexadecimal value of the ASCII code for the character).  The exact
sets of "safe" and "unsafe" characters can be found in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt">W3C URL spec</a>,
but generally, alphanumerics are safe and most punctuation marks
aren't.  When in doubt, you can always %-encode a character, even
when you don't have to.

<p>The first parameter is the object type to search for.  A search
operators on one type of object; this must be one of the following:

<ul>
   <li><b>game</b> - search for a game listing
   <li><b>list</b> - search for a Recommended List
   <li><b>poll</b> - search for a poll
   <li><b>comp</b> - search for a competition/award event
   <li><b>member</b> - search the member directory
   <li><b>tag</b> - search the list of tags
</ul>

<p>The object type parameter requires no value, so simply tack it onto
the URL as <tt>&amp;game</tt>, <tt>&amp;list</tt>, etc.

<p>The additional query parameters are:

<p><b>searchfor</b>: The search term, including full-text search
keywords and search operators.  This is the same string you'd type
into the regular IFDB search user interface.

<h3>Search operators</h3>

<p>The format of the search string used in the API, including the
search operators, is the same as for the regular IFDB user interface
for search.  That's beyond the scope of this documentation; simply
refer to the regular Search help page for details.  The API uses the
same underlying search engine that the user interface does, so any new
operators added in the future will be available through the API as
soon as they're available in the UI.

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>To search for a game listing for <tt>Deep Space Drifter</tt>:

<p><pre>https://ifdb.org/search?json&amp;game&amp;searchfor=Deep+Space+Drifter
</pre>

<h2>Reply</h2>

The response is a JSON object, like this:

<p><pre>
{
  "games": [
    {
      "tuid": "k82q3libhff6ks8l",
      "title": "Deep Space Drifter",
      "link": "https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=k82q3libhff6ks8l",
      "author": "Michael J. Roberts and Steve McAdams",
      "devsys": "TADS 2",
      "published": {
        "machine": "1990",
        "printable": "1990"
      },
      "averageRating": 2.428571428,
      "numRatings": 7,
      "starRating": 2.5,
      "starSort": 2.16074024927881,
      "coverArtLink": "https://ifdb.org/coverart?id=k82q3libhff6ks8l&version=4"
    }
  ]
}
</pre></p>

<p>A search that yields no results will simply return an empty "group"
tag.  (A search with zero results isn't an error; it's a search that
successfully determined that there were no items in the database
matching the search terms.)

<p>The contents of the item tags vary according to the object type.  The
following sections describe the results for the different object types.

<p>Most of the item replies include a "<?=helpWinLink("help-tuid", "TUID")?>" value.
This the internal ID for the object assigned by IFDB
when the object's IFDB listing was originally created.  A TUID
uniquely identifies the object on IFDB, and it never changes for a
given object, so it will always identify the same object as long as
the listing exists on IFDB.  The TUID can be used in various IFDB URLs
to access pages related to the object.

<h3>Games</h3>

<p>
<pre>
{
  "games": [
    {
      "tuid": "<i>TUID</i>",
      "title": "<i>Title of the game</i>",
      "link": "<i>URL to game's main listing page</i>",
      "author": "<i>Author(s)</i>",
      "devsys": "<i>Development system used to create this game</i>",
      "published": {
        "machine": "<i>Publication date in YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD format</i>",
        "printable": "<i>Publication date in English format</i>"
      },
      "averageRating": <i>Raw "star" rating average</i>,
      "numRatings": <i>Number of ratings in the average (note that reviews can choose to "omit" their ratings from the average)</i>,
      "starRating": <i>Rounded "star" rating average</i>,
      "starSort": <i>Star rating for sorting; see below</i>,
      "coverArtLink": "<i>URL to cover art (this key will be absent if there's no cover art)</i>"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>The "star" rating average is given in three forms.  The "raw" average
is the arithmetic average of the ratings, as a decimal floating point
value (e.g., "3.3333").  The "rounded" average is the average value
rounded to the nearest half-star (e.g., "3.5").  IFDB itself generally
displays the rounded value, since it uses a graphical image with
half-star resolution.

<p>We determine the games with the highest ratings using
<a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/ranking-items-with-star-ratings.html">Evan
Miller's formula</a>, which we call "starSort." We used to sort by average
rating, but this would tend to rank games with just one perfect 5-star rating
above games with dozens of 5-star ratings and a few 4-star ratings.
Evan Miller's formula sorts by our confidence in the game, by adding five
"fake" ratings to the average (one 1-star, one 2-star, one 3-star, one 4-star,
and one 5-star rating) and subtracting the standard deviation from the result.

<p>coverArtLink, if present, will contain a URL to the cover art
image.  This URL will yield an image file (currently, this can be a
JPEG, PNG, or GIF file) containing the full-sized image.  You can get
a "thumbnail" - i.e., the image at a reduced size - by appending
<tt>&amp;thumbnail=WxH</tt> to the URL, where W is the desired width
in pixels, and H is the desired height.  The thumbnailer maintains the
original image's aspect ratio by treating the request size as a
bounding rectangle, and reducing the display size as needed to fit
this bounding box.

<p>The publication date is provided in two separate formats for the
client's convenience.  The "machine" version is a standard numeric
YYYY-MM-DD format, such as "2009-09-14" for September 14, 2009, or
simply the four-digit year if the full date isn't available.  The
"printable" version is the equivalent date with the full month name
spelled out in English, such as "September 14, 2009", or again just
the four-digit year if that's all that's available.  These will be
present as empty tags if the publication date isn't in the database.

<p>More detail is available for each game in the search results, using
the <a href="viewgame">viewgame API</a>.

</p>

<h3>Competitions/Awards</h3>

<p>
<pre>
{
  "competitions": [

      "tuid": "<i>TUID</i>",
      "title": "<i>Title of the competition</i>",
      "link": "<i>URL to competition's main display page</i>",
      "desc": "<i>Description (in HTML format)</i>",
      "numGames": <i>Number of games listed</i>,
      "numDivisions": <i>Number of divisions</i>
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Members</h3>

<p>
<pre>
{
  "members": [
    {
      "tuid": "<i>TUID</i>",
      "name": "<i>Display name</i>",
      "link": "<i>URL to member's public profile page</i>",
      "location": "<i>Location, set in the user's profile</i>",

      "pictureLink": "<i>Link to the user's profile photo (this key will be absent if the user has no profile picture)</i>"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>The location is usually a city or country name; the exact format is
unpredictable because it's simply whatever the user entered in her
profile.

<p>If present, the pictureLink value will be a URL to the image; this
will yield an image file, currently of type JPEG, PNG, or GIF.  You
can get a thumbnail just as for game cover art images, by appending
<tt>&amp;thumbnail=WxH</tt> to the URL.

<h3>Tags</h3>

<p>
<pre>
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "id": "<i>The text of the tag</i>",
      "numGames": <i>Number of games tagged with this tag</i>,
      "link": "<i>A link to search results for that tag</i>"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Legacy XML format</h2>

You can also use our legacy XML-based search.

<p>To search for a game listing for <tt>Deep Space Drifter</tt> in XML:

<p><pre>https://ifdb.org/search?xml&amp;game&amp;searchfor=Deep+Space+Drifter
</pre>

<p>The reply is an XML file with this enclosing structure:

<p><pre>
   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;
   &lt;searchReply xmlns="http://ifdb.org/api/xmlns"&gt;
      <i>reply-data</i>
   &lt;/searchReply&gt;
</pre>

<p>If an error occurs, the <i>reply-data</i> will be an &lt;error&gt; tag
   containing a human-readable text error message:

<p><pre>
   &lt;error&gt;
      <i>error message text</i>
   &lt;/error&gt;
</pre>

<p>On success, the <i>reply-data</i> will be a "group" tag for the object
type, containing a list of zero or more "item" tags for the individual
results.

<p>
<style nonce="<?php global $nonce; echo $nonce; ?>" type="text/css">
table.typemap {
    border: 1px solid #808080;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    margin: 1em 2em 1em 2em;
}
table.typemap th {
    border: 1px solid #808080;
}
table.typemap td {
    border: 1px solid #808080;
    padding: 0 1em 0 1em;
    text-align: left;
}
</style>
<table class="typemap" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
   <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>Group Tag</th> <th>Item Tag</th> </tr>

   <tr> <td>Game</td> <td>&lt;games&gt;</td> <td>&lt;game&gt;</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>Recommended List</td> <td>&lt;lists&gt;</td> <td>&lt;list&gt;</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>Poll</td> <td>&lt;polls&gt;</td> <td>&lt;poll&gt;</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>Competition/Awards</td> <td>&lt;comps&gt;</td> <td>&lt;comp&gt;</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>Member</td> <td>&lt;members&gt;</td> <td>&lt;member&gt;</td> </tr>
   <tr> <td>Tag</td> <td>&lt;tags&gt;</td> <td>&lt;tag&gt;</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>For example, for a Poll search yielding three results, the
<i>reply-data</i> section would look like this:

<p><pre>
   &lt;polls&gt;
     &lt;poll&gt;
       <i>first item</i>
     &lt;/poll&gt;
     &lt;poll&gt;
       <i>second item</i>
     &lt;/poll&gt;
     &lt;poll&gt;
       <i>third item</i>
     &lt;/poll&gt;
   &lt;/polls&gt;
</pre>

<p>A search that yields no results will simply return an empty "group"
tag.  (A search with zero results isn't an error; it's a search that
successfully determined that there were no items in the database
matching the search terms.)

<p>The contents of the item tags vary according to the object type.  The
following sections describe the results for the different object types.

<p>Most of the item replies include a "<?=helpWinLink("help-tuid", "TUID")?>" value.
This the internal ID for the object assigned by IFDB
when the object's IFDB listing was originally created.  A TUID
uniquely identifies the object on IFDB, and it never changes for a
given object, so it will always identify the same object as long as
the listing exists on IFDB.  The TUID can be used in various IFDB URLs
to access pages related to the object.

<h3>Games</h3>

  &lt;game&gt;
    &lt;tuid&gt;<i>TUID</i>&lt;/tuid&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;<i>Title of the game</i>&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link&gt;<i>URL to game's main listing page</i>&lt;/link&gt;

    &lt;/published&gt;
    &lt;coverArtLink&gt;<i>URL to cover art</i>&lt;/coverArtLink&gt;
  &lt;/game&gt;
</pre>

<p>The hasCoverArt value is simply "yes" or "no", indicating whether
or not the game has cover art.  If this is "yes", the coverArtLink
element will also be present, and will contain a URL to the cover art
image.  This URL will yield an image file (currently, this can be a
JPEG, PNG, or GIF file) containing the full-sized image.  You can get
