<h1>What do the tag numbers mean?</h1>

<p>There are two numbers in parentheses listed after each tag in a
game listing.  For example:

<p><div class=indented>
    IF Competition 2001 (3/22)
</div>

<p>The <b>first number</b> is the number of <b>other people who added
the same tag to the game</b>.  (Why bother adding a tag someone else
already added?  It's basically a vote for the tag: it strengthens the
tag's association with the game.  This improves the search engine
by telling it that the game is that much more relevant when someone
searches for the tag.)

<p>The <b>second number</b> is the number of <b>other games with 
the same tag</b>.  You can see the full list by clicking on the tag.
