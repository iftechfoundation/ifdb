<h1>What's this "Remarks" field for?</h1>

<p>Quick summary: if you have an advertising link to post, please just
type it in the box!

<p>Longer explanation: This sounds ridiculous, but there's a whole
industry devoted to posting spam to collaborative sites like IFDB.
They employ a workforce whose basic job is to create Web forum
accounts with spam links for profiles.  The spammers don't expect real
people to look at the fake profiles, but they do hope that search
engines will discover the ad links and count them in their page
ranking statistics.

<p>The Remarks field is part of our latest defense,
which is to have an actual human review each registration.
The Remarks field is key to the review: it gives you a chance to
demonstrate that you're not a spammer.  So what should you type here?
First off, don't just leave it blank, because that won't help us with
our review; we'll just have to bounce your request back to you for
another try.  Second, experience has shown that if you type "I'm not a
spammer", you almost certainly are.  Third, you don't have to prove
here that you're not a robot - that's what the squiggly word test
below the Remarks field is for.

<p>What we are looking for here is some kind of evidence that you know
something about IFDB's subject matter.  The reason this is helpful in
weeding out spam is that the spammers spend their wretched days creating
accounts like this at one site after another.  They have quotas to
meet, so they can't be bothered to know the details of each site.
They don't care that a site is about muscle cars or pinball machines -
they just want to post their Vi@gr@ spam and move on to the next site
on their list.  So, what we're looking for is something that
demonstrates that you're actually interested in IFDB, not just in
creating Web accounts for the sake of creating Web accounts.  For
example, if this were a site about pinball, something like "I love
Williams machines from the mid 80s" or "I own a Twilight Zone with the
blue LED clock mod" would do the trick.  On the other hand, if you're
<i>not</i> interested in IFDB per se, but you're just looking for a
place to post spam, please just enter your spam link into the Remarks
box, and we'll be happy to file it in a suitable location.
