<h1>What's a "Story File"?</h1>

<p>Most Interactive Fiction these days is written with one of the
popular IF development systems, nearly all of which produce games that
need a separate "Interpreter" program to run.  The games are packaged
as something we call Story Files - these are essentially just big data
files containing all of the game's text and programming instructions
in a special computer-readable format.  The Interpreter's job is to
read that special format and run the game.

<p>The big advantage of the Story File system is that it eliminates
dependencies on any particular operating system.  You can copy a Story
File to any type of computer, and as long as the right Interpreter
program is available there, you can run the game.  So it doesn't
matter whether the game's author uses the same system that you do -
even if the game was written on Windows and you're using a Macintosh,
you just copy the Story File and load it into your Macintosh version
of the Interpreter.

<p>Another advantage is that Story Files aren't considered as risky,
in terms of viruses and the like, as native applications.  The
Interpreter programs by their nature limit the game's access to your
computer.  Obviously, you must never assume that any format is
completely safe, so you should take the same <a
href="help-dlsafety">precautions</a> you would with any downloaded
software - but most people feel that using a Story File adds another
layer of protection.

<p>The disadvantage of Story Files is that you need that separate
Interpreter program to play the game, so there's an extra step in
setting up a game if you don't already have the right Interpreter
installed.  On the other hand, once you set up a given Interpreter, you
can play all of the games written for that system without any extra
work.
