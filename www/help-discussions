<h1>IFDB Discussions</h1>

<p>You can add comments to various pages on IFDB, including
game reviews, Recommended Lists, and polls.  You can also add
comments to another member's profile.

<p>You can reply other people's comments, which makes for a simple
discussion system.  This isn't a full-fledged "forum" system, let
alone a replacement for the
<a href="https://intfiction.org">intfiction.org</a> forum, but for comments
related to a particular IFDB page, it has the advantage of keeping the
discussion together with its subject.

<p>You can start a discussion by clicking the "Add a comment" link
shown below a game review, on a list or poll's main page, or on a
user's profile page.  A "View comments" link will appear as soon as a
page has comments.  You can reply to a comment by clicking the "Reply"
link next to the comment.
