    <b>Are you sure you want to delete this poll?</b>

    <p>If you click "Yes" below, the poll will be permanently
    deleted.  This action is irrevocable - it can't be undone. If you
    change your mind later, you'll have to re-create the poll from
    scratch, and all votes will have to be re-entered.

    <p>The main valid reason to delete a poll is that
    you've discovered that it's a duplicate, or the poll isn't
    appropriate or doesn't ask a relevant question about IF works.

    <p>Keep in mind that if you delete a poll, any links from
    other web sites to the poll will be broken.  It's safest
    to delete only polls that were created very recently, because
    it's less likely that anyone will have found it and linked to it.

    <p>Do you still want to delete this poll?"
