<h1>What is community moderation?</h1>

<p>IFDB doesn't have formal moderators or censors who decide what you
can and can't see in terms of reviews, game listings, and
recommendations.  Instead, we use <b>community moderation</b>, which
means that we rely on IFDB's whole membership to provide guidance
about which reviews are useful and which aren't.

<p>Community moderation works by letting everyone provide
<i>guidance</i> instead of censorship.  It obviously wouldn't work if
everyone could veto anything they didn't like - pretty soon there'd be
nothing left on the site except material so bland and uninteresting
that no one could disagree with it (and probably not even that, since
someone would undoubtedly veto it for being too bland and
uninteresting).

<p>So instead of a veto, everyone gets a vote.  The chief tool for
community moderation of reviews on IFDB is the Helpfulness vote.  As
votes accumulate, the reviews that members collectively deem to be the
best (however they choose to define "best") will move to the top of
the list, and less helpful reviews will move to the bottom.  This
makes it easier to set your own threshold for quality when you're
browsing, since you know the good stuff will be listed first.
