<h1>E-Mail Spam Cloaking</h1>

<p>Before sending email to another member, you should check their
profile address to make sure it's not "cloaked."  Some people
intentionally obscure their email addresses to escape the notice of
spam robots, which constantly scan the web looking for fresh victims.
Look for these signs of a cloaked address:

<ul>

<li><b>SPAM</b> or <b>NOSPAM</b> embedded in the address.  For
example, someone might write <tt>johnNOSPAMdoe@myisp.com</tt> -
you'd just remove the word NOSPAM from the middle of the address,
and what's left over is the actual address.

<li><b>Other ALL-CAPITAL words</b> besides SPAM or NOSPAM can be
used the same way.

<li><b>Spelled-out punctuation</b> usually needs to be changed to
the actual punctuation marks.  For instance, <tt>john hyphen doe at
myisp dot com</tt> would have to be changed to <tt>john-doe@myisp.com</tt>.

</ul>

<p>Note that this list isn't exhaustive - if it were, the spammers
would just program their robots with everything on the list, defeating
the entire purpose!  The idea is that everyone does something a little
different, choosing a scheme that's self-explanatory to real humans,
but inscrutable to robots.  So use your real-human common sense, and
look at each address to see if it looks like it's cloaked in some way.
