<h1>Game file in a ZIP</h1>

<p>For a compressed game file, it's helpful for IFDB to know the
name of the main game file <i>within</i> the ZIP file.  This lets
download tools automatically extract the file and run the game.

<p>For example, if you're uploading a ZIP file that contains a Z-code
".z5" story file, along with some other supporting files
(documentation, for example), you'd enter the name of the .z5 file.

<p>Use Unix-style relative paths if necessary - ZIP always uses "/" to
separate directory names, even on operating systems with different
path separators.  For example, if you're linking to a ZIP file that
contains a folder called Games and a Z-Machine file called MyGame.z5
within the folder, you'd enter "Games/MyGame.z5".
