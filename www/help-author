<h1>Tips for the Author Field</h1>

<h2>Linking to a profile</h2>

<p>If the game's author is an IFDB member, you can link the game to
the author's profile by putting the profile <a
href="help-tuid">TUID</a> in {curly braces} after the author's name.
For example, <b>Arthur Dent {a10x00139ke9041j}</b>.  You can find the
TUID on the profile page.

<h2>Identifying the author</h2>

<p>Most freeware IF shows the author's byline as part of its introductory
text, so you can usually find the author by running the game and scanning
the first screen or two of output.

<p>For a commercial game, enter the author's or designer's name rather
than a company name.  If the author isn't credited anywhere, you can
enter the name of the company that developed or published the game.

<p>If the game was released without any author or publisher credits,
enter "Anonymous" as the author.

<p>If you think the game has an author credit, but you can't actually
find the information for some reason (for example, your only copy is
for an obsolete hardware platform, or you simply don't have a copy of
the game), enter "Unknown."

<p>For a game with multiple authors, simply enter them the way they're
shown in the game's byline: "Julia Smithers and Orson D. Bisonhonker,"
for example.  For a commercial game with a lengthy list of credits, enter
the primary author or authors.
