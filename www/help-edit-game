<h1>Guidelines for Game Listings</h1>

<ul class=doublespace>

<li>Anyone is allowed to edit a game listing, whether they wrote the
game or not.

<li>Keep the listing factual. If you're not sure of a piece of data,
leave it blank (or if it's already there, don't change it).

<li><b>Don't</b> include spoilers.  Don't give away plot twists,
solutions to puzzles, or any other of the game's secrets.

<li><b>Don't</b> use the listing as a review.  If you want to express
your opinion about the game, write an actual review instead (by going
to the game's home page and clicking "Write a review").

<li><b>Don't</b> attack the author.

<li>Avoid things like "better" or "worse" comparisons to other games,
judgments on writing quality, overall excellence, etc.  Those belong in a
review, not a listing.

<li>It's okay to "sell" the game a little in its description, but
keep it informative, basically factual, and focused on the game.  The
description should be like the "blurb" on the inside flap of a book -
it should give readers an idea of what the game is about and what its
overall style is.

  <ul>
    <li>"An emotional
    roller-coaster ride with plot twists that keep you guessing to the
    end" - that's fine, because it tells you something about the style
    of the game.

    <li>"The first good text game since Infocom stopped making them!" -
    <b>not</b> so good, because it doesn't tell you anything concrete
    about the game, and it's completely subjective.
  </ul>

</ul>
