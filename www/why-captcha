<h1>Why do I have to enter a code?</h1>

<p>We ask you to enter a code to verify that you're a real person, not
a spam robot.  Spammers use bots to harvest email addresses
and stuff spam into comment pages.  The code entry is designed to
block bots.

<p>If you can't make out the code in the image, try clicking the
Reload button (<img src="captchaRefresh.gif" alt="Picture of Reload
button" align="absmiddle">).  The image is randomly distorted to
prevent spam-bot software from reading it, but occasionally the
randomness is too much even for real humans.

<p>If you can't read the image because of a sight impairment, click
the Audio button (<img src="captchaAudio.gif" alt="Picture of Audio
button" align="absmiddle">) to play an audio version of the code.
