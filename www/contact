<h1>Contacting Us</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/committees/ifdb/">IFDB committee</a> of the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation</a> maintains IFDB.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or questions about this site, you can
reach us by email at <a href="mailto:ifdbadmin@ifdb.org">ifdbadmin@ifdb.org</a>.
To suggest a new feature or to report a technical problem, you can use IFDB's
<a href="https://github.com/iftechfoundation/ifdb-suggestion-tracker/issues">suggestion tracker</a>.
Please read the advice below about reporting specific kinds of
problems.

<h3>Reporting errors in game listings</h3>

<p>If you catch an error in a game listing (a typo, factual
inaccuracy, etc), there's no need to send us email.  Instead, please
take advantage of IFDB's community-edited,
<a href="http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki">Wiki</a>-like design and
make the correction yourself.  This is the best way to keep IFDB
accurate and up-to-date, since it avoids the inevitable delay of
involving a site administrator in every change.

<p>Likewise, if you discover that there's a game missing from our
database, you can add a new listing yourself.

<p>You can edit any game's listing by clicking the "Edit this page"
link at the bottom of the game's main page.  To add a game, click
the "Add a new game listing" link on the IFDB home page.


<h3>Reporting broken links</h3>

<p>A broken link in the "External Links" section of a game listing should be
treated like any other listing error: you can correct it yourself by
editing the page containing the bad link.  To edit a game's page,
click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of the page.

<p>A word of caution, though.  It's much better to <b>correct</b> a
link than to delete it outright.  If you know that a link has moved to
a new location, or contains a typo, by all means update/correct it.
But if you're not sure why a link isn't working, it's probably better
to leave the broken link as is than to delete it.  Links are sometimes
only temporarily broken - the target site might be down for
maintenance, for example, or the site admin might be in the process of
moving files around.  We strongly recommend that before you delete a
broken link, you contact the game's author or the target site's owner
to determine whether the link is truly broken or just temporarily out
of commission.  If you find out that the file was intentionally
removed and is no longer available anywhere else, that's the time to
actually delete the link.


<h3>Reporting technical problems</h3>

<p>If you encounter any problems using the site (especially an error
message saying something to the effect that "you should try again
later or contact us if the problem persists," and <i>especially</i> if
you did try again later and the problem did persist), please let us
know what you were trying to do, in as much detail as you can.  The
most important thing is to tell us the <b>step by step</b> procedure
that triggers the problem, since we have the best chance of fixing it
if we can reproduce the problem ourselves.  Budget constraints and a
certain prima donna attitude among our senior staff force us to assign
bug-fixing duties to our most junior technicians, whose thankless toil
in the dark recesses of our underground laboratory complex leaves
them so broken-spirited and bewildered that everything has to be
spelled out to them in minute, tedious detail; so we ask for your
understanding and cooperation in providing as complete a report
as you can.
