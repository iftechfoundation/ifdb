<h1>Who Qualifies for Top Reviewer Status?</h1>

<p>The top reviewer list is determined by who writes the most
reviews - and the most helpful reviews, as judged by other IFDB
members.

<p>Top Reviewer status is a ranking of who has the most <a
href="help-ff">Frequent Fiction</a> points.  The Top 10 Reviewers are
the ten members with the most points, and likewise for the Top 25, Top
50, and Top 100.

<p>IFDB is a community enterprise.  There's no elite group of
appointed experts who get to decide which games are good and which
aren't.  Everyone can contribute, and Frequent Fiction points are
meant to provide some small recognition for that.

<p>Note that Top Reviewer status is dynamic, because
the status is always relative to other members.  You and others can
earn more points any time.  The site calculates your
points and keeps them up to date automatically, so you don't have to
do anything special to make sure your points are counted.
