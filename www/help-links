<h1>External Links</h1>

<p><b>URL:</b> Enter the full URL.

<ul>

   <li>When linking to a downloadable file, link directly to the file,
rather than to a separate "gateway" page.  The "Play Online" button
assumes that links lead directly to downloadable files.

   <li>If the game's author doesn't allow you to link directly to the
file, don't add it as a download link; instead, link to the author's
site via the Web Site field on the game's main page.

   <li>For files stored at the IF Archive, link to the <b>main</b> IF
Archive site (http://www.ifarchive.org/...), <b>not</b> to a mirror.
IFDB will automatically substitute a mirror site based on the user's
preferences, but it can only do this with links that start off pointing
to the main IF Archive URL.

</ul>

<p><b>Title:</b> Enter a short title for the link, for display in
the External Links box on the game's page.

<p><b>Description:</b> If the file's purpose isn't obvious enough
from the title, you can add a brief description here.
This is optional.  <b>Don't</b> use this to describe the game itself,
since that belongs in the main game description.

<p><b>"This is a playable game file":</b> This tells the "Play Online"
button and other tools whether or not this file contains the actual
game program.

<ul>

   <li>Check the box if the file contains a playable version of
the game, in the form of a native executable program (such as a
Windows .EXE file) or a Story File for one of the interpreter-based
systems (Z-Machine, TADS, etc).

   <li>Leave the box unchecked for collateral files like
documentation, walk-throughs, and so on.

   <li><b>Don't</b> check this box for source-code files - even though
that <i>is</i> one form of a game program, it's usually not a
<i>readily playable</i> form, since a player would need to set up a
whole build environment.  (We'd make an exception if source code is
the <i>only</i> form in which the game is distributed, though.)

</ul>

<p><b>File Type:</b> Use the list to select the data format of the
file:

<ul>

   <li>If you checked the "game file" box, the list shows the various
interpreter formats, along with "Executable" and "Installer."
"Installer" means that the file is an executable SETUP program that
you run once to install the game on your system; "Executable" means
that the file is simply the game program itself, and you simply run it
directly to play the game.

   <li>For a game file, if you can't find the game's specific format
in the list, choose "Story File."  This is the generic file type for
interpreter-based games.  Always choose the specific type if the
right one is in the list, though, since the "Play Online" button can't
offer any help for the generic Story File type.

   <li>For non-game files, the list offers a selection of common
file formats.  There are so many file formats in the world that the
list simply can't be exhaustive, so it shows only the most common
formats for IF collateral material.  If you can't find the right
format, choose the generic "Document."

   <li>If the file is packaged using a compression format or a special
file-transfer encoding (ZIP, StuffIt, hqx, tar, .tar.gz, etc), pick
the format of the <b>main file</b> within the compressed/encoded file
(see below).

</ul>

<p><b>Compression:</b> If the file is compressed (ZIP, StuffIt),
specially encoded for file transfers (hqx, tar), or both (.tar.gz,
.sit.hqx), pick the packaging format here.  Note that there are
separate entries for the common compound formats (tarball, .sit.hqx) -
pick the one that represents the full set of wrappers, if possible, so
that automated tools will be able to apply all of the necessary
unpacking steps.

<p><b>Main File:</b> For a compressed game file, enter the filename of
the actual game file within the compressed file. Use Unix-style
relative paths if necessary (ZIP uses "/" to separate directory names).
For example, if you're linking to a ZIP file that contains a folder
called Games and a Z-Machine file called MyGame.z5 within the folder,
you'd enter "Games/MyGame.z5".  This lets the "Play Online" button and
other automated tools find the playable game file after unpacking the
compressed file.  For non-game files, enter the filename of the most
important file, as you see fit; you can leave this blank if "most
important" isn't meaningful for this link.
