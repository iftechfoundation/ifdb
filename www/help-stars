<h1>Star Ratings</h1>

<p>The "star" rating system lets you express your overall judgment on
a game by giving it a score on a 1 to 5 scale.  We know it's not easy
to reduce something so complex to a single number, but most readers
find this sort of summary judgment really helpful.  You can always
explain in your review why you chose the score you did.

<p>The star scale is inherently subjective, so it's up to you to
determine what the different levels mean.  As a rough guide,
though, we recommend something like this:<p>

<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

<tr valign=baseline>
<td style="padding-right: 1em;"><?php echo showStars(1); ?></td>
<td>A terrible game; completely unrecommended</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=baseline>
<td style="padding-right: 1em;"><?php echo showStars(2); ?></td>
<td>A badly flawed game, but maybe worth a look</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=baseline>
<td style="padding-right: 1em;"><?php echo showStars(3); ?></td>
<td>An average game; or a mixed bag, with some real strengths
but some serious weaknesses</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=baseline>
<td style="padding-right: 1em;"><?php echo showStars(4); ?></td>
<td>A very good game, highly recommended</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=baseline>
<td style="padding-right: 1em;"><?php echo showStars(5); ?></td>
<td>An excellent, exceptional game</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>We recommend that you "grade on a curve" - reserve the 5- and 1-star
ratings for the really exceptional games (good and bad).  If you rate
everything a 5, it makes it hard for your handful of all-time favorites
to stand out.

<h2>Leaving out the rating</h2>

<p>You can write a review without entering a rating.  If you do this,
your review won't affect the game's average rating - omitting a rating
is <b>not</b> the same as giving a game 0 stars.

<p>Some example of reasons why you might want to omit a rating:
<ul class=doublespace>

<li>You haven't played enough of the game to feel you can give it a
meaningful score, but you nonetheless want to share your impressions
of what you've seen so far via a review.

<li>You've only played an older, out-of-date version of the game, and
you've heard the newer version is considerably better/worse/different -
so you don't want your rating to affect the overall score for the
current version.

</ul>

<h2>I want to give this game ZERO stars!</h2>

<p>Sorry, the rating scale is 1 to 5; there's no "zero stars" rating.
(We don't allow 0-star ratings because that would sometimes be
confusing - it would be hard to tell the difference in some cases
between "awful" and merely "unrated.")

<p>Don't think of "1 star" as being like "1 dollar" - stars aren't
bling, they're ratings.  You're not giving the author of a bad game a
tip she can spend at FrobMart.  Since 1 star is the lowest score, a
1-star rating is saying exactly what you want: "this game is among
the worst I've played."
