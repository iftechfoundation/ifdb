<h1>What's an IFDB Poll?</h1>

<p>A poll is essentially a <a href="help-reclist">Recommended List</a>
in reverse.  A Recommended
List lets you create a list of your favorite games in a particular
category, to share with the rest of IFDB.  A poll turns the tables: it
lets you ask everyone for recommendations for some particular kind of
game you're looking for.

<p>The category can be anything you want it to be.  Just describe what
kind of game you're looking for.

<p>Once you create a poll, it will appear on the IFDB home page,
inviting other members to submit their "votes" - suggestions for games
that fit the category.  As the votes come in, they'll show up
automatically on the poll's page, so you can check back from time to
time to learn which games people have recommended.

<p>A nice feature of polls is that anyone can see the results, so
everyone can benefit from the recommendations.  So a poll essentially
becomes a collaborative Recommended List built by the whole IFDB
community.
