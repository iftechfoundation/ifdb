<h1>Pending External Links</h1>

<p>The "pending" checkbox for an external link tells IFDB that the
file isn't available for download yet, but will be soon.  If you check
this box, IFDB will do two things:

<ul class=doublespace>

   <li>Hide the link on the game's home page, so that users viewing the
   page won't be confused by a broken link error.

   <li>Check the URL periodically to see if it's working yet, and remove
   the "pending" flag as soon as the link works.

</ul>

<p>This option is especially useful with the IF Archive, because
files uploaded to the Archive are not available for download until
they're reviewed by administrators.  This process usually takes a few
days.  You <i>could</i> just wait to add the download link until the
file appears on the Archive, but the "pending" option saves you that
extra editing step.  Just check the box, and IFDB will monitor the
Archive for you, updating the link as soon as it's working.
