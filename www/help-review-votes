<h1>Review Voting Options</h1>

<p>These options let you "review the reviewer," to improve your own
experience with IFDB and help guide other members to the best reviews.

<p><b>Helpful (Yes/No):</b> Vote Yes if you think the review does a
good job of sharing the reviewer's opinion of the game - it's
respectful, informative, well-written, insightful, or just generally
helpful.  Voting Yes <b>doesn't</b> mean that you agree with
everything the reviewer said, or even with her overall opinion of the
game.  Reasons to vote No would include being off-topic,
disrespectful, or overly spoilery.  As votes accumulate, the reviews
that members collectively deem to be the best (however they choose to
define "best") will move to the top of the list, and less helpful
reviews will move to the bottom.

<p><b>Promote/demote this user:</b> These affect how you (and only
you) see this user's reviews throughout IFDB.  If you Promote the
user, you'll see her reviews listed first when viewing a game; if you
Demote her, her reviews will move to the end of the list.
(You can view and change your promotions and demotions via the
 <a href="userfilter?list" onclick="return openUserFilter();">user filter
editor</a>.)

<p><a name="plonk"><b>Plonk this user:</b></a>
This is the nuclear option, for someone you
find so annoying that you never again want to see anything they write.
If you plonk a user, <b>all</b> of her reviews will be omitted when
you view game pages throughout IFDB.  This only affects you - it won't
actually delete the user's reviews or hide them when other members
view the same game pages.  (You can change your mind and un-plonk
someone later via the <a href="userfilter?list"
onclick="javascript:window.opener.location = 'userfilter?list';return false;"
>user filter editor</a>.)

<p><b>Flag spoilers:</b> Mark this review as containing
<b>unhidden</b> spoilers.  A spoiler gives away a secret that you're
meant to discover in the course of playing the game, spoiling the fun
of finding it or figuring it out on your own.  After you flag the
review, IFDB will put a warning label on the review when other users
view it.  <b>This affects all users</b>, so use this command
responsibly.  <b>Don't</b> flag a review for spoilers that are already
properly hidden with "click to see" warnings - only flag it if the
spoilers are out in the open.

<p><b>Flag as inappropriate:</b> Notify the moderators that this
review may violate the
<a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> or the
<a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>.
