<h1><i>Baf's Guide</i> Identifiers</h1>

<p>IFDB's predecessor,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110109233058/http://www.wurb.com/if">
<i>Baf's Guide to the IF Archive</i></a>, was an extensive catalog
of the games at the <a href="https://www.ifarchive.org">IF Archive</a>.
Baf's Guide included search and cross-referencing features, and
provided well-written capsule reviews for a huge selection of the
IF Archive's games.

<p>Baf's Guide assigned a unique number to each game in its
database. This number was designed to be a permanent ID for the
game. If you go to the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110109233058/http://www.wurb.com/if">
Baf's Guide site</a> and navigate to a page for one of the games,
the original URL of the game page should look something like this:

<p><pre>
  http://www.wurb.com/if/game/395
</pre>

<p>The number at the end of the URL is the Baf's ID - in this
case, 395.

<p>Since Baf's Guide is no longer maintained, newer games won't
have a Baf's Guide ID.
