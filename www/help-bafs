<h1><i>Baf's Guide</i> Identifiers</h1>

<a href="http://www.wurb.com/if"><i>Baf's Guide to the IF
Archive</i></a> is an extensive catalog of the games at the <a
href="http://www.ifarchive.org">IF Archive</a>.  Baf's includes
extensive search and cross-referencing features, and provides
well-written capsule reviews for a huge selection of the games at the
Archive.

<p><i>Baf's Guide</i> is one of the key resources for anyone
interested in IF, so we wanted to make it easy to link each game to
its Baf's page.  All you need is the Baf's ID for the game.  The
Guide assigns a unique ID to each game in its database - this is a
number, and it's designed to be a permanent ID for the game, even as
Baf's evolves.

<p>To find the Baf's ID for a game, go to the <a
href="http://www.wurb.com/if"> Baf's Guide site</a> and search for the
game.  Once you find the game, view its page by clicking on the game
in the search results.  Then look at your browser's Address bar: it
should have a URL that looks something like this:

<p><pre>
  http://www.wurb.com/if/game/395
</pre>

<p>The number at the end of the URL is the Baf's ID - in this case,
395.

<p>If you can't find the game in the Baf's database, it probably just
isn't listed yet.  In this case, it doesn't have a Baf's ID at all, so
you should just leave this field blank.
