<h1>Cross-References</h1>

<p>When a game is part of a "family tree" of related games, you can use
cross-references to enter the relationships.

<p>A cross-reference is always entered in the "child" game's listing.
The child is the derived work - the later version of the game, which
was based on the "parent", or the original version.  A child can be a
translation, adaptation, sequel, prequel, remake, spoof, port to a
different programming language, or just a game that makes some kind of
reference to another game.

<p>What about the parent-to-child relationship?  IFDB makes this easy:
you only have to enter the information on the child game's page, and
the system automatically "mirrors" the relationship to show the
corresponding information on the parent game's page.
