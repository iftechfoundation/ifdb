<h1>What's a TUID?</h1>

<p>A TUID is a "tads.org Unique Identifier" - a serial number that
uniquely identifies a game listing or member profile in our database.
A TUID has no meaning outside of our database, but we show them in the
game listing because you can use them to write permanent, stable
references to listings in our database.  The database is designed so
that once a TUID is assigned to a game, that identifier will stick
with the game for as long as it's in our database.

<p>You can find the TUID for a game on its home page, in the
Details section.

<p>The format of a TUID is a mix of random letters and numbers, 16
characters long.  We <i>could</i> have just used a simple sequential
number as the ID (this is how <a href="/help-bafs"><i>Baf's
Guide</i></a> works), but we decided to use a long string of gibberish
instead for a reason: these sorts of identifiers easily stand out from
the crowd in full-text searches.
