<h1>IF Archive Mirrors</h1>

<p>A "mirror" is essentially a backup server for another Internet
site.  A mirror site duplicates the contents of its main site -
typically, a mirror takes a snapshot of its main site about once a
day, so it always has an up-to-date copy of everything on the main
site.

<p>Mirrors are useful for several reasons:

   <ul>

      <li>They share the file-serving load, so
        the main server doesn't have to do all the work

      <li>When the main server is off-line, you can usually still
        reach a mirror site, since mirrors are independent and
        not affected by outages on the main server

      <li>A mirror might be geographically closer to you than the
        main site, potentially allowing for faster downloads

   </ul>

<p>Many of the files listed on IFDB are stored on the <a
href="http://www.ifarchive.org">IF Archive</a>, which has a number
of mirror sites.  The Archive mirror you
select in your user preferences will be used for all of the IF Archive
file links that IFDB displays for you.

<p>You'll probably get better performance from some mirror sites than
from others, but it's hard to predict which mirrors will work best for
any given person - that depends on things like geographical proximity,
network topology, and network traffic volumes.  The best bet is to
experiment with a few of the mirrors to see which give you the fastest
downloads.
