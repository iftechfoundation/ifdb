<h1>Policy for Download Links</h1>

<p>Please link only to <b>legal</b> downloads.  This means that
the copyright owner must explicitly allow the download.

<p>Our Terms of Use prohibit uploading material that violates anyone's
copyrights or other intellectual property rights.  This prohibition
includes merely <b>linking</b> to illegal material or to sites that
traffic in illegal material, such as "warez" or "abandonware" sites.
Such linking can be considered "contributory infringement," which
means that it's essentially as illegal as offering the unauthorized
content directly.

<p>Violating this policy could seriously damage IFDB, both legally
and in terms of its reputation.  Please do your best to comply to
help ensure that the site can continue operating.

<p>It's always acceptable to link to sites that maintain and enforce
similar policies of diligent copyright compliance, such as the <a
href="http://www.ifarchive.org">IF Archive</a>.
